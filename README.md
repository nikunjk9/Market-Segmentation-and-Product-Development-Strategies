# MARKET SEGMENTATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES

The research topic is "Market Segmentation and Product Development Strategies." This research addresses a important component of modern business strategy, especially in the rapidly growing e-commerce sector. One way for online retailers to gain competitive advantage, increase customer satisfaction and drive profitability is by understanding how to efficiently segment markets and develop products that suit particular groups of customers. This implies that businesses must understand who their customers are exactly before designing a product or service for them. Furthermore, as big data and advanced analytics continue to rise, there are new opportunities for using customer data in making more informed decisions about markets. The aim of this research is bridging the gap between market segmentation insights and practical product development strategies that ultimately lead to better business outcomes.
